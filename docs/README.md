## <a id="introduction"></a> 1. Introduction
The PixelPhraser – CommerceTools Connector automates product description creation, leveraging Google Cloud Vision AI and Generative AI to analyze product images and generate detailed, engaging, and SEO-friendly descriptions. This solution intelligently interprets product images by identifying objects, colors, and sentiments, transforming this data into informative content that resonates with customers and improves search visibility.

A Custom Application within the CommerceTools platform empowers users to review, approve, or reject these AI-generated descriptions, ensuring brand consistency and high content quality. This streamlined process significantly enhances operational efficiency while improving the accuracy and appeal of product information.

Additionally, the generated descriptions are automatically translated into multiple languages, with the target languages configurable within the Merchant Center Custom Application. This enables effortless localization, helping merchants deliver a personalized shopping experience across global markets—ultimately driving sales and increasing customer satisfaction.

## <a id="features"></a> 2. Features
- **Automated Event-Driven Processing**
- **Advanced Image Analysis with Vision AI**
- **Generative AI-Powered Product Description Generation**
- **Temporary Storage Management**
- **Custom Application for Review**

## <a id="functional-overview"></a> 3. Functional Overview
This connector is designed to automate the generation of product descriptions based on product creation events. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Receiving Event Triggers:**
   - The connector listens for product creation events to initiate the description generation process.

2. **Checking Attribute:**
   - It checks if the `generateDescription` attribute is set to `true`. 
   - If `true`, the connector proceeds with the description generation; if `false`, the process is skipped.

3. **Analyzing Product Images:**
   - The connector interprets product images using Vision AI.
   - It captures various attributes such as labels, colors, text, objects, and web entities from the images.

4. **Generating Descriptions:**
   - High-quality, detailed descriptions are generated based on the analyzed image data using Google Generative AI.

5. **Translate Descriptions:**
   - These generated descriptions are then translated into the configured languages.

6. **Updating Custom Objects:**
   - The generated descriptions are stored temporarily in CommerceTools Custom Objects for customer review.

7. **User  Interface for Review and Configuration:**
   - Customers can search for descriptions, view associated images, and accept or reject the generated content through a user-friendly interface. Additionally, this Custom Application allows customers to seamlessly configure the languages into which the descriptions are translated.

## <a id="key-components"></a> 5. Key Components
### Event Listener
- **Functionality:** Listens for product publication events in CommerceTools. Receives the event payload, parses product details, and checks if the "generateDescription" flag is true. If the attribute is present and true, it triggers description generation; otherwise, it skips the process.
### Image Analysis with Vision AI
- **Module:** `productAnalysis`
- **Functionality:** Analyzes product image URLs, extracting key visual elements such as labels, objects, colors, text, and web entities.
- **Outputs:** Structured image data providing foundational information for description generation. 
### Description Generation and Translation with Generative AI
- **Module:** `generateProductDescription`, `translateProductDescription`
- **Functionality:** Generates product descriptions based on the structured image data. Ensures descriptions are relevant and engaging for e-commerce use, then translate the descriptions into the configured languages.
- **Outputs:** Fully generated multilingual product description ready for integration in CommerceTools.
### Temporary Storage in CommerceTools
- **Creation:** Initializes a custom object with placeholder metadata and description data.
- **Update:** Finalizes the object by adding generated description and relevant metadata, preparing it for customer review.
### User  Interface for Review and Configuration
- **Functionality:** Allows customers to review and approve or reject these AI-generated descriptions. Additionally, this Custom Application allows customers to seamlessly configure the languages into which the descriptions are translated.
